### **Reflection:**
For this lab, my topic was states I have lived in and I chose to use the three search queries "washington", "new mexico", and "wisconsin". 

These three states have signficance to me as I have lived in those three very different states, and are a part of my story. Additionally, the reason I chose these three locations and wanted to make this comparison was to see if only news reports would show or if info about the states would show in the results and word clouds, or if results about the people or culture in those states or other if something else would show up in the resulting searches and word clouds. For this reason I also chose to omit the word "state" from my search queries.

In the word clouds, the similiarties I saw were that each of the word cloud's largest term was the search term itself, such as New Mexico for the search term "new mexico".  While I didn't see many terms related to news in each of the word clouds, what I did see was that words related to the culture of the state or that were characteristic of it were in the word clouds. For instance, for Washington, I saw the words "ocean" (Washington includes pudget sound which leads into the ocean), "walk", "discover", "created", "activities" (Washington does have many places to do activities includign walking and hiking and more), "homeless" (Washington including Seattle has a homelessness problem and a large number of homeless living here). For New Mexico this included the words "albuquerque", "food", "native", "tradition", "vibrant", "odditites", "travel", "southeast".  For Wisconsin this included "cheese" (Wisconsin is a dairy state and produces a lot of cheese), "southern", "dairyland", "curds", "rural", "timber", "football", "wisconsin-raised", "badger" (mascot for wisconsin university football team). Additionally, both New Mexico and Wisconsin word clouds had the term "video", while the Washington word cloud appeared to lack it. I am unsure of the reason why this is, but I think the word "video" appeared due to all of the results being YouTube Videos.  

The reasons for the patterns showing between the three word clouds are the way the search engine works. Since I searched the term "new mexico" for new mexico and "washington" and so on, the search results are going to show results with the search term itself contained in the title of the video, with similar terms being shown after those.  

In the future my research on this topic could be improved by searching the terms on Yelp, Google, or other search engines or sites as this could give different results, and potential more as well instead of just videos. This would mean using Google or Yelp's APIs accordingly. Certain platforms such as yelp are also better for specific things to search such as resturants or stores, where as Google is good for general searches. This is another thing to keep in mind for future research on the topic I chose or if a similar exercise is done in the future. 

What stood out to me and that I was surprised about was that for Washington's word cloud, there also were multiple words related to emotions or feelings and words you might hear on the news or related to politics such as "anger", "reaction", "guard", "social", "nation", "missile", "media", "shockwaves", "viral", "reaction", "storm", "attorney", "took", and "force". This might be explained by how Washignton is a blue state in terms of political standings and views. I also was surprised by some of the words which felt random, for instance for Wisconsin, some of the words were "watch", "is", "state", "video" (this might have been due to the fact a YouTube search was used), "com", "good", "itinerary" (maybe for people traveling to wisconsin to watch?), "marketing", "follow", "iron". Additonally I also was surprised by the second largest terms, which some made sense while others did not (video for instance showed up larger due to how the results were YouTube videos). In the Washington word cloud, the second largest terms were "DC" and "of". In the New Mexico word cloud, the second largest terms were "video", "place" and "state" and "albuquerque". In the Wisconsin word cloud, the second largest terms were "com", "state", "watch", and "is".
