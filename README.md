### Lilian Law

For this lab, my topic was states I have lived in and I chose to use the three search queries "washington", "new mexico", and "wisconsin". 

These three states have signficance to me as I have lived in those three very different states, and are a part of my story. Additionally, I wanted to see if only news reports would show or if info about the states would show in the results and the word clouds. For this reason I omitted the word "state" from my search queries, and wanted to see if it would be about the state, the people in it, or something else.

In the word clouds, the similiarties I saw were... I saw... (discuss if about news or not and such and common words)
